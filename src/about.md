I'm a regular guy with no experience in politics; yes, I do think that makes me an excellent candidate for President of the United States.

I'm a husband, father, brother, and friend.

I'm neither a Democrat or Republican but I lean toward Republican. I consider myself a centrist, sharing tenets from both sides.

I'm old, but not that old. It is time again for younger Presidents; we don't need 70 and 80 year old Presidents for this country. There's no way they can understand the world the way the rest of us do.

I believe the President of the United States should focus all of their efforts on America and Americans, not their own personal gain. I will not make decisions based on what will get me reelected. If I'm a successful President, I'll run for re-election, but will not throw the country under the bus to win.
