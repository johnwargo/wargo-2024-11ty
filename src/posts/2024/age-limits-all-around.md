I believe there should be mandatory age limits for the President as well as Congress. This country is being led by doddering old people (mostly men) who should be out spoiling their grandchildren or great grandchildren, not trying to run this country. We have all these politicians keeping their posts into their 80's when they should instead step back and mentor the younger generation that should be running the country.

Is a president in his 80's really able to understand and represent the needs and desires of younger generations? No way, today's culture (music, art, societal norms, etc.) is an aberration to that older generation. Just like my parent's generation didn't understand ours, these very old elected officials are very disconnected from multiple generations and their associated cultures.

I've already decided that I'm not going to run for President again in 2028. I'm in my early 60's now and it I don't make it this year, I'm going to work until I retire then spend the rest of my days spending my children's inheritance.

What I see in Congress is elected officials becoming richer and richer every year in office. Of course they work into their 80's, they're too greedy to do anything else. 

As much as I respect Joe Biden, he's too old to even be President now let alone succeed as President for another full term. Think about most Presidents we know, they go into office with dark hair, but leave with a full head of grey. The job of US President is a HARD one with lots of stress and very long days. Lets have someone younger do it.

Our former President is also too old to be President again, but on top of that, he's too stupid and too crazy to be President again. Electing him to office again would be, in my opinion, the worst possible thing that could happen to this country next to Nuclear War and another Depression. I'm running for President for no other reason than to help keep our idiot former President from office again.

What we have right now with our two main Presidential candidates is two people with HUGE egos thinking they're the best we have to offer our country right now. We must, and I absolutely mean must, do whatever we can to keep our former President from ever being in office again. Joe Biden thinking he's the best candidate for the job is hubris; he's too old, can barely stitch three sentences together without fumbling, and should be anywhere else but the Oval Office. 

Our former President? He should be in jail.

Join with me and help me take the country back from the doddering old men and women running the country. I promise you that  I'll work hard to push to an age limit for at least President and hopefully Congress.
