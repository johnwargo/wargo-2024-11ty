I'm suspending my campaign for President of the United States. My heartfelt thanks to all of you who have supported me through these last 4 years. I'm suspending the campaign because with less than two weeks left before the election I don't want to steal votes from the only candidate that can keep our idiot former president from office. I feel very strongly that the Orange Man is an existential threat to the survival of the United States as we know it.

This country isn't perfect, but it is pretty damn amazing. Our Idiot Former President's (OIFP) perpetual lying is only making it worse and I do not believe there's any need to make us great again, we're already great.

I will not run for President again; I'm 62 years old and, in my belief, I will be too old to be effective in the role when I'm 66. People in their mid 60's and beyond should spend time with their families, they earned it. Also, we should use our skills and experiences to help mentor up and coming public servants, not spend energy in my late 70's seeking power (like OIFP does today).
