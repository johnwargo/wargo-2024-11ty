I received an email today from JD Vance with the headline:

> I just got off the phone with President Trump

Oooh, exciting. The Republican VP candidate speaks on the phone with the Presidential candidate? And he's letting me know immediately after he got off the phone with him? Wow, how cool is that. Does that salutation really work with Republican voters?

Next, in the body of the email, came the pitch:

> Friend, you came HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by President Trump himself.
>
>So now that I’m recruiting the strongest MAGA Republicans to join my Official Vice Presidential Advisory Board, I want to extend the VERY FIRST invitation to YOU!
>
> ACCEPT INVITATION <<Link to Invitation>>
>
> President Trump and I both agree - it’s time that REAL American Patriots like you have a say in how this country gets run.
>
> When we take back the White House, we won’t be kowtowing to the swampy agendas of DEEP STATE bureaucrats. We’ll be taking advice from YOU.
> 
> Friend - YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON FOR THIS JOB.
>
> Please, accept your exclusive invitation to my Vice Presidential Advisory Board TODAY. >> <<Link to Invitation>>
>
> TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
>
> Thank you,
>
> JD Vance

This is really interesting, I didn't realize that JD Vance and I were friends. I used to be a registered Republican, but JD Vance and I are definitely not friends.

The (former) President (he's not the President anymore) recommeded me personally?  Do people really believe that?

Stongest MAGA Republicans?  Nope, that's not me. MAGA is a bunch of crap.

Extending the VERY FIRST invitation to me? Do people really believe that? Do Republican voters really get this email and think:

1. JD Vance is emailing them directly?
2. He sent his very first email message to me?

if so, we have a problem because neigther can be true and if anyone believes that...

He wants me to be on his Vice Presidential Advisory Board? Yipee, where do I sign up?

Seriously though, do people really believe this nonsense? I certainly don't and I've been begging the Republican Party to remove me from all mailing lists for years now and they continue to send me ridiculous messages like this in direct violation of US law.

We need to get away from all this "Radical Left"/"Radical Right", "kowtowing to the swampy agendas of DEEP STATE bureaucrats" bullshit and get back to doing what's right for the country. Nothing else matters. It's all this ridiculous grandstanding, name calling, and lies that put us in this situation. Our politicians aren't looking out for your best interests or the interests of the country. For them this is all about POWER and how to keep it (and make more money doing it).

Cast aside these idiots and vote for a candidate that won't participate in any of it. Someone like me who'll tell you the way it is without all that other crap. Lets all just be reasonable again.
