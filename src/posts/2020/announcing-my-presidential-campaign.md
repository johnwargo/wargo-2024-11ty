Today, I officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States in 2024. What this country needs is a strong, Independent candidate and I want to be that candidate (with your help, of course).

I want to be the first candidate to announce their candidacy since its time to get started now for the election in four years. Immediately after the inauguration in 2016, I announced my candidacy for United States President in 2020. For various reasons, I suspended my campaign shortly before the 2020 election with the full understanding that Iâ€™d run again in 2024. 

Its time to kick up that campaign again and get to work. Are you with me?
